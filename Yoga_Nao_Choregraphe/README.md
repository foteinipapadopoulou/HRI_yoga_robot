# Yoga Nao Choreographe

This folder contains the implementation of the Yoga Nao robot in Choregraphe. 

To import the project, click on `File` > `Open Project` and then navigate to this folder and click the `Yoga_Nao.pml` file.

Then you can choose between which behavior you want to run.
There are two folders in which you can run the `behavior.xar` file:
1. `behavior_with_feedback`
2. `behavior_without_feedback`

### Note:
Unzip the `yoga_music.zip`. Github doesn't allow to upload a file more than 100Mb, so that's why it is zipped.
